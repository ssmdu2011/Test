# Wholegrain Web Developer role challenge

Hi, thanks for making time to take on this challenge.

## What you'll need
- Ability to set up a local WordPress environment and install the Advanced Custom Fields plugin.
- Some time

## The challenge: build a cards component
Build a custom ACF block to display three cards with the elements shown in this basic wireframe: [https://www.wholegraindigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/wholegrain-web-developer-test-cards-block.png](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/wholegrain-web-developer-test-cards-block.png)

There is no design.

### Tips
- Consider how the component functions across different devices with various screen sizes, but assume you are only building for the most commonly used browsers.
- Make any unprovided styling decisions yourself. This includes things like colours, text size, and spacing. For efficiency use a system font.

## Recommended working approach
1. Fork the main branch of this repository: 
2. Spin up a local WordPress environment with the most recent version of WordPress and install Advanced Custom Fields.
3. Clone the main branch of this repository to your new environment's themes folder and activate the theme.
4. Add a Cards block to your page in the editor.
5. Attempt the challenge!
6. Complete your response.

### Working approach notes
- We suggest spending around 2 hours on this challenge.
- Work only within the components/cards directory (do not create any additional components, do not update the style.css, etc).
- If you decide to add any custom fields for the block, ensure the ACF JSON is saved to the theme. The quickest way to do this is by creating an acf-json folder before you save any field groups; this will utilise ACF's local JSON feature.

## Completing your response
When you are ready to send us your code, please do the following:
1. Commit and push your code to a new Gitlab, Github, or Bitbucket repository and provide access to the technical contact provided by the hiring manager.
2. Send an email to the hiring manager confirming you have done this, including a brief summary of how you found the challenge.
